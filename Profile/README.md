Our team is developing an educational platform to help individuals learn about hydroponic farming. We realize the challenge of limited land and knowledge in starting their small farm, therefore we decided to create an application that provides complete information about hydroponic farming. Our platform aims to solve this problem by offering features such as educational videos, disease detection and discussion forums. To make our platform more effective, our research questions asked what features would be most effective in a hydroponic farming educational platform that could facilitate learning and application of the method by individuals with limited land resources and knowledge. Our main goal is to promote sustainable farming practices, enable more individuals to engage in farming activities, and address the problem of limited availability of land in urban areas through the use of hydroponic farming.
